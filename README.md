# Auto ML Classifier

I have demonstrated my proficiency in developing advanced algorithms and models for classification tasks by creating a machine learning model that can automatically classify data. The model I developed is capable of accurately and efficiently classifying data automatically.

## Installation

To install and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using pip. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the web app using the following command: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Access the web app by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

Just pop your text into the app and it'll sort the data for you. Or, if you've got a CSV file, upload it and the app will use 13 models to classify the data. The app will spit out a model that you can use for other stuff too.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the web app:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.
2. Drag and drop your CSV data.
3. Click the "Profiling" page for data visualization.
4. Click the "Modelling" and choose target column, then click "Run Modelling" to make the model
5. Click the "Download" page for downloading best model based on pipeline.
